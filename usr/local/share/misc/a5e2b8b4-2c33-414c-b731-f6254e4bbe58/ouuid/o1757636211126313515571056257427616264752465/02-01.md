Command Not in Search Path
==========================

This chapter assumes a \*nix system.

Example
-------

    user@machine:~$ ls
    myscript
    user@machine:~$ myscript
    bash: myscript: command not found...
    user@machine:~$ type myscript
    bash: type: myscript: not found    
    user@machine:~$ echo $PATH | sed 's/:/\n/g' | grep "^[.]$" | wc -l
    0
 
 Alternative Solutions
 ---------------------
 
 - Add to the `PATH` environment variable the directory in which the command is found.
 - Create a shell function by which the command may be found.
 - Create an alias by which the command may be found.
 - Provide the full path to the command.
